# Celeste Strawberry Jam for Archipelago

A manual AP world that adds Strawberry Jam to Archipelago multi-world randomizer. To beat, you unlock access to the heartside by unlocking all of those lobby's crystal hearts. Currently has Beginner and Intermediate Lobbies coded in.

Suggested way of playing is by using 2 profiles in Celeste: a fresh profile for unlocking checks, and a profile that has access to a lobby's heartside for when you're in go mode.
